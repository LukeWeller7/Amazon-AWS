# Amazon S3 - Simple Storage Service

There are differnet ways to interact with amazon S3, this is how I initially learnt how to use the Amazon CLI and scripts to interact with S3 and buckets, this was done using python and boto3. All of this is found in the amazon-CLI folder.

You can also interact with buckets on amazon AWS the same way you would with any other service. This is found in the amazon AWS folder.
